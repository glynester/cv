I bring enthusiasm, passion and tenacious problem solving skills to the team. I love to learn new things and I am not afraid of hard work.<BR>    
I'm looking for an inspiring Developer role (full stack) where I can continue to learn new things every day, in a development team creating innovative and helpful applications. Having spent a great deal of time learning Javascript, I feel that I am strongly positioned to step into a role that will utilise these skills. However, I will gladly learn any new language/library in addition to the ones I know. 

<div id="skills"><h2><a href="#TOC">Skills</a></h2></div>
I get a huge amount of satisfaction from getting computer programs to function as I intend them to by writing the code instructions.<BR>   
I love to solve problems (I consider myself to be very good at it) and I love to learn new things and get to grips with new technologies. In the business consultant/analyst roles I had during the latter half of my career, I often acted as a translator between the needs of software users and the development teams. These years of work experience honed my problem solving skills. I can now apply these skills in the role of developer.<BR>   
Over my career, I have also developed a great eye for what makes software well designed from a user's perspective and what makes for a pleasant user experience. I have now also added strong backend coding and database design to my list of skills.<BR>  
I always take great pride in my work and am meticulous in my attention to detail.
