I bring enthusiam, passion and tenacious problem solving skills to the team. I love to learn new things and I am not afraid of hard work.<BR>    
I'm looking for an inspiring Developer role (full stack) where I can continue to learn new things every day, in a development team creating innovative/world changing applications.  

<div id="skills"><h2><a href="#TOC">Skills</a></h2></div>
I get a huge amount of satisfaction from getting computer programs to function as I intend them to by writing the code instructions.<BR>   
I love to solve problems (I consider myself to be very good at it) and I love to learn new things and get to grips with new technologies. In the business consultant/analyst roles I had during the latter half of my career, I often acted as a translator between the needs of software users and the development teams. These years of work experience honed my problem solving skills. I can now apply these skills in the role of developer.<BR>   
Over my career, I have also developed a great eye for what makes software well designed from a user's perspective and what makes for a pleasant user experience. I have now also added strong backend coding and database design to my list of skills.<BR>  
I always take great pride in my work and am meticulous in my attention to detail.   

<h3>Additional Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn new processes and software quickly</li>
<li>Very strong programming/logical and numerical abilities</li>
<li>Full project lifecycle experience</li>
<li>Strongly computer literate with an excellent working knowledge of a wide variety of application programs, (strong skills in Excel and MS Access) and Enterprise Information Systems</li>
<li>Strong software and user interface design knowledge</li>
<li>Strong financial/accounting knowledge</li>
<li>Self motivated, conscientious and responsible</li>
<li>Strong communicator with excellent written skills</li>
<li>Confident and effective in relating to people</li>
<li>Organised and methodical</li>
<li>Personable and professional in manner and presentation</li>
</ul>
